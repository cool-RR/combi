    '''
    Metaclass for `ContextManager`.
    
    Use this directly as a decorator to create a `ContextManager` from a
    generator function.
    
    Example:
    
        @ContextManagerType
        def MyContextManager():
            # preparation
            try:
                yield
            finally:
                pass # cleanup
                
    The resulting context manager could be called either with the `with`
    keyword or by using it as a decorator to a function.
                
    For more details, see documentation of the containing module,
    `python_toolbox.context_manager`.
