This module defines the `DontCopyPersistent` class.

See its documentation for more information.
'''

from python_toolbox.copy_mode import CopyMode

class DontCopyPersistent(CopyMode):
    '''
    A copy mode under which `Persistent` objects aren't actually copied.
    
    When a `Persistent` is getting deepcopied with this mode, a reference to
    the original object would be returned instead of actually deepcopying it.
    
    Keep in mind that if the `Persistent` holds reference to additional
    objects, they too will not really be copied under this mode.
