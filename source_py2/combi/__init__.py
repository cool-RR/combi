Combi is a Pythonic package for combinatorics.

Combi lets you explore spaces of permutations and combinations as if they were
Python sequences, but without generating all the permutations/combinations in
advance. It lets you specify a lot of special conditions on these spaces. It
also provides a few more classes that might be useful in combinatorics
programming.
