class ProxyProperty(object):
    '''
    Property that serves as a proxy to an attribute of the parent object.
    
    When you create a `ProxyProperty`, you pass in the name of the attribute
    (or nested attribute) that it should proxy. (Prefixed with a dot.) Then,
    every time the property is `set`ed or `get`ed, the attribute is `set`ed or
    `get`ed instead.
    
    Example:
    
        class Chair(object):
        
            def __init__(self, whatever):
                self.whatever = whatever
                
            whatever_proxy = ProxyProperty('.whatever')
            
        chair = Chair(3)
        
        assert chair.whatever == chair.whatever_proxy == 3
        chair.whatever_proxy = 4
        assert chair.whatever == chair.whatever_proxy == 4
                
                
    You may also refer to a nested attribute of the object rather than a direct
    one; for example, you can do `ProxyProperty('.whatever.x.height')` and it
    will access the `.height` attribute of the `.x` attribute of `.whatever`.

        '''
        Construct the `ProxyProperty`.
        
        `attribute_name` is the name of the attribute that we will proxy,
        prefixed with a dot, like '.whatever'.
