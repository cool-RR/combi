    Round a number, with lots of different options for rounding.
    
    Basic usage:

        >>> cute_round(7.456)
        7
    
    The optional `step=1` argument can be changed to change the definition of a
    round number. e.g., if you set `step=100`, then 1234 will be rounded to
    1200. `step` doesn't have to be an integer.
        
    There are different rounding modes:

        RoundMode.CLOSEST_OR_DOWN
        
            Default mode: Round to the closest round number. If we're smack in
            the middle, like 4.5, round down to 4.
            
        RoundMode.CLOSEST_OR_UP
        
            Round to the closest round number. If we're smack in the middle,
            like 4.5, round up to 5.

        RoundMode.ALWAYS_DOWN
        
            Always round down. Even 4.99 gets rounded down to 4.

        RoundMode.ALWAYS_UP
        
            Always round up. Even 4.01 gets rounded up to 5.
        
        RoundMode.PROBABILISTIC
        
            Probabilistic round, giving a random result depending on how close
            the number is to each of the two surrounding round numbers. For
            example, if you round 4.5 with this mode, you'll get either 4 or 5
            with an equal probability. If you'll round 4.1 with this mode,
            there's a 90% chance you'll get 4, and a 10% chance you'll get 5.
