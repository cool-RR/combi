    An emitter you can `emit` from to call all its callable outputs.
    
    This is an extension of the original `Emitter`, see its documentation for
    more info.
    
    What this adds is that it keeps track of which emitter system this emitter
    belongs to, and it allows freezing the cache rebuilding for better speed
    when adding many emitters to the system.
