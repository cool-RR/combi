'''Module for doing a binary search in a sequence.'''

# Todo: wrap all things in tuples?
# 
# todo: add option to specify `cmp`.
# 
# todo: i think `binary_search_by_index` should have the core logic, and the
# other one will use it. I think this will save many sequence accesses, and
# some sequences can be expensive.
#
# todo: ensure there are no `if variable` checks where we're thinking of None
# but the variable might be False

    difference is that instead of returning a result in terms of sequence
    items, it returns the indexes of these items in the sequence.
