    Subclasses should override `reentrant_enter` and `reentrant_exit`, which
    are analogues to `__enter__` and `__exit__`, except they are called only on
    the outermost suite. In other words: When you enter the reentrant context
    manager for the first time, `reentrant_enter` is called. If you enter it
    for a second time, nothing is called. Now `.depth == 2`. Exit it now,
    nothing is called. Exit it again, and `reentrant_exit` is called.
    
    Note: The value returned by `reentrant_enter` will be returned by all the
    no-op `__enter__` actions contained in the outermost suite.
