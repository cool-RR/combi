    among them are a plethora of arithmetic operations (both between bags and
    bags and between bags and integers), comparison methods between bags, and
    more. This class is also more restricted than `collections.Counter`; only
    positive integers may be used as counts (zeros are weeded out), so we don't
    need to deal with all the complications of non-numerical counts.

    Also, unlike `collections.Counter`:
    
     -  Items are ordered by insertion order. (Simliarly to
        `collections.OrderedDict`.)

     - It's immutable, therefore it's also hashable, and thus it can be used as
       a key in dicts and sets.
