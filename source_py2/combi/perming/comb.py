    '''
    A combination of items from a `CombSpace`.
    
    In combinatorics, a combination is like a permutation except with no order.
    In the `combi` package, we implement that by making the items in `Comb` be
    in canonical order. (This has the same effect as having no order because
    each combination of items can only appear once, in the canonical order,
    rather than many different times in many different orders like with
    `Perm`.)
    
    Example:
    
        >>> comb_space = CombSpace('abcde', 3)
        >>> comb = Comb('bcd', comb_space)
        >>> comb
        <Comb, n_elements=3: ('a', 'b', 'c')>
        >>> comb_space.index(comb)
        6

        # we got is a `Comb`, then we'll take the one from it.
