class Emitter(object):
    '''
    An emitter you can `emit` from to call all its callable outputs.
    
    The emitter idea is a variation on the publisher-subscriber design pattern.

    Every emitter has a set of inputs and a set of outputs. The inputs, if
    there are any, must be emitters themselves. So when you `emit` on any of
    this emitter's inputs, it's as if you `emit`ted on this emitter as well.
    (Recursively, of course.)
    
    The outputs are a bit different. An emitter can have as outputs both (a)
    other emitters and (b) callable objects. (Which means, functions or
    function-like objects.)
    
    There's no need to explain (a): If `emitter_1` has as an output
    `emitter_2`, then `emitter_2` has as an input `emitter_1`, which works like
    how we explained above about inputs.
    
    But now (b): An emitter can have callables as outputs. (Without these, the
    emitter idea won't have much use.) These callables simply get called
    whenever the emitter or one of its inputs get `emit`ted.
    
    The callables that you register as outputs are functions that need to be
    called when the original event that caused the `emit` action happens.
