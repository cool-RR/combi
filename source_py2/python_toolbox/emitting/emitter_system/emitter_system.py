    '''
    A system of emitters, representing a set of possible events in a program.
    
    `EmitterSystem` offers a few advantages over using plain emitters.
    
    There are the `bottom_emitter` and `top_emitter`, which allow,
    respectively, to keep track of each `emit`ting that goes on, and to
    generate an `emit`ting that affects all emitters in the system.
    
    The `EmitterSystem` also offers a context manager,
    `.freeze_cache_rebuilding`. When you do actions using this context manager,
    the emitters will not rebuild their cache when changing their
    inputs/outputs. When the outermost context manager has exited, all the
    caches for these emitters will get rebuilt.

    # redundant links between boxes. I'm a bit suspicious of it. The next
    # logical step is to make inputs and outputs abstract.
