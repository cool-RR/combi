    '''
    Decorator for setting a function to be ready for profiling.
    
    For example:
    
        @profile_ready()
        def f(x, y):
            do_something_long_and_complicated()
            
    The advantages of this over regular `cProfile` are:
    
     1. It doesn't interfere with the function's return value.
     
     2. You can set the function to be profiled *when* you want, on the fly.
     
     3. You can have the profile results handled in various useful ways.
     
    How can you set the function to be profiled? There are a few ways:
    
    You can set `f.profiling_on=True` for the function to be profiled on the
    next call. It will only be profiled once, unless you set
    `f.off_after=False`, and then it will be profiled every time until you set
    `f.profiling_on=False`.
    
    You can also set `f.condition`. You set it to a condition function taking
    as arguments the decorated function and any arguments (positional and
    keyword) that were given to the decorated function. If the condition
    function returns `True`, profiling will be on for this function call,
    `f.condition` will be reset to `None` afterwards, and profiling will be
    turned off afterwards as well. (Unless, again, `f.off_after` is set to
    `False`.)
    
    Using `profile_handler` you can say what will be done with profile results.
    If `profile_handler` is an `int`, the profile results will be printed, with
    the sort order determined by `profile_handler`. If `profile_handler` is a
    directory path, profiles will be saved to files in that directory. If
    `profile_handler` is details on how to send email, the profile will be sent
    as an attached file via email, on a separate thread.
    
    To send email, supply a `profile_handler` like so, with values separated by
    newlines:
