    Randomly partition `sequence` into partitions of size `partition_size`.
    
    If the sequence can't be divided into precisely equal partitions, the last
    partition will contain less members than all the other partitions.
    
    Example:
    
        >>> random_partitions([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
        [[0, 2], [1, 4], [3]]
        
    (You need to give *either* a `partition_size` *or* an `n_partitions`
    argument, not both.)
    
    Specify `allow_remainder=False` to enforce that the all the partition sizes
    be equal; if there's a remainder while `allow_remainder=False`, an
    exception will be raised.
