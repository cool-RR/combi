    An improved version of Python's builtin `enum.Enum` type.
    
    Note that on Python 2, you must include a line like this in your enum
    definition:
    
        __order__ = 'CHOCOLATE VANILLA RASPBERRY BANANA'

    This defines the order of elements. (On Python 3 you don't have to do this
    because Python 3 can figure out the order by itself.)
    
    `CuteEnum` provides the following benefits:
    
      - Each item has a property `number` which is its serial number in the
        enum.
        
      - Items are comparable with each other based on that serial number. So
        sequences of enum items can be sorted.
        
      - The enum type itself can be accessed as a sequence, and you can access
        its items like this: `MyEnum[7]`.
