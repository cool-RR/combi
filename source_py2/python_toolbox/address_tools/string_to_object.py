def resolve(string, root=None, namespace={}):
    r'''
    Resolve an address into a Python object. A more powerful version of `eval`.
    
    The main advantage it has over `eval` is that it automatically imports
    whichever modules are needed to resolve the string.
    
    For example:
    
        >>> address_tools.resolve('[list, [1, 2], email]')
        [<type 'list'>, [1, 2], <module 'email' from
        'c:\Python27\lib\email\__init__.pyc'>]
        
    `root` is an object (usually a module) whose attributes will be looked at
    when searching for the object. `namespace` is a `dict` whose keys will be
    searched as well.

    # user's arguments.
