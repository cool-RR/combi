:class:`CombSpace` and :class:`Comb`
====================================

:class:`CombSpace`
------------------

.. class:: CombSpace(iterable_or_length, n_elements, *, slice_=None, perm_type=None)

   A space of `combinations`_.
   
   This is a subclass of :class:`PermSpace`; see its documentation for more
   details.
   
   Each item in a :class:`CombSpace` is a :class:`Comb`, i.e. a combination.
   This is similar to :func:`itertools.combinations`, except it offers far, far
   more functionality. The combinations may be accessed by index number, the
   combinations can be of a custom type, the space may be sliced, etc.
   
   Here is the simplest possible :class:`CombSpace`:
   
      >>> comb_space = CombSpace(4, 2)
      <CombSpace: 0..3, n_elements=2>
      >>> comb_space[2]
      <Comb, n_elements=2: (0, 3)>
      >>> tuple(comb_space)
      (<Comb, n_elements=2: (0, 1)>, <Comb, n_elements=2: (0, 2)>,
       <Comb, n_elements=2: (0, 3)>, <Comb, n_elements=2: (1, 2)>,
       <Comb, n_elements=2: (1, 3)>, <Comb, n_elements=2: (2, 3)>)

   The members are :class:`Comb` objects, which are sequence-like objects that
   have extra functionality. (See documentation of :class:`Comb` and its base
   class :class:`Perm` for more info.)
       

:class:`Comb`
-------------

.. class:: Comb(perm_sequence, perm_space=None)
   
   A combination of items from a :class:`CombSpace`.
   
   In combinatorics, a `combination`_ is like a `permutation`_ except with no order.
   In the ``combi`` package, we implement that by making the items in :class:`Comb` be
   in canonical order. (This has the same effect as having no order because
   each combination of items can only appear once, in the canonical order,
   rather than many different times in many different orders like with
   :class:`Perm`.)
   
   Example:
   
      >>> comb_space = CombSpace('abcde', 3)
      >>> comb = Comb('bcd', comb_space)
      >>> comb
      <Comb, n_elements=3: ('a', 'b', 'c')>
      >>> comb_space.index(comb)
      6
