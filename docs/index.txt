The Combi Documentation
=======================

Combi is a Pythonic package for `combinatorics`_.

Combi lets you explore spaces of `permutations`_ and `combinations`_ as if they
were Python sequences, but without generating all the permutations/combinations
in advance. It lets you specify a lot of special conditions on these spaces. It
also provides a few more classes that might be useful in combinatorics
programming.

Basic usage
===========

Use :class:`PermSpace` to create a permutation space:

   >>> from combi import *
   >>> perm_space = PermSpace('meow')
   
It behaves like a sequence:

   >>> len(perm_space)
   24
   >>> perm_space[7]
   <Perm: ('e', 'm', 'w', 'o')>
   >>> perm_space.index('mowe')
   3
   
And yet the permutations are created on-demand rather than in advance.

Use :class:`CombSpace` to create a combination space, where order doesn't
matter:

   >>> comb_space = CombSpace(('vanilla', 'chocolate', 'strawberry'), 2)
   >>> comb_space
   <CombSpace: ('vanilla', 'chocolate', 'strawberry'), n_elements=2>
   >>> comb_space[2]
   <Comb, n_elements=2: ('chocolate', 'strawberry')>
   >>> len(comb_space)
   3

Features
========

- :class:`PermSpace` lets you explore a space of permutations as if it was a
  Python sequence.
  
  * Permutations are generated on-demand, so huge permutation spaces can be 
    created easily without big memory footprint.
  * :class:`PermSpace` will notice if you have repeating elements in your
    sequence, and treat all occurences of the same value as interchangable 
    rather than create redundant permutations.
  * A custom domain can be specified instead of just using index numbers.
  * You may specify some elements to be fixed, so they'll point to the same
    value in all permutations. (Useful for limiting an experiment to a subset 
    of the original permutation space.)
  * Permutation spaces may be limited to a certain degree of permutations. (A
    permutation's degree is the number of transformations it takes to make it.)
  * `k-permutations`_ are supported.
  * You may specify a custom type for the generated permutations, so you could 
    implement your own functionality on them.
    
- :class:`CombSpace` lets you explore a space of combinations as if it was a
  Python sequence.
  
- :class:`MapSpace` is like Python's built-in :func:`map`, except it's a
  sequence that allows index access.
  
- :class:`ProductSpace` is like Python's :func:`itertools.product`, except
  it's a sequence that allows index access.
  
- :class:`ChainSpace` is like Python's :func:`itertools.chain`, except
  it's a sequence that allows index access.
  
- :class:`SelectionSpace` is a space of all selections from a sequence, of all
  possible lengths.
  
- The :class:`Bag` class is a multiset like Python's 
  :class:`collections.Counter`, except it offers far more functionality, like 
  more :ref:`arithmetic operations between bags <bags-operations>`, 
  :ref:`comparison between bags <bags-comparisons>`, and more. (It can do that
  because unlike Python's :class:`collections.Counter`, it only allows natural
  numbers as keys.)
  
- Classes :class:`FrozenBag`, :class:`OrderedBag` and 
  :class:`FrozenOrderedBag` are provided, which are variations on :class:`Bag`.
