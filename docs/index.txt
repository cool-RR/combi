The Combi Documentation
=======================

Combi is a Pythonic package for combinatorics.

Combi lets you explore spaces of `permutations`_ and `combinations`_ as if they
were Python sequences, but without generating all the permutations/combinations
in advance. It also lets you specify a lot of special conditions on these
spaces.
