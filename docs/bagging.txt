Bag classes
===========

Combi provides 4 bag classes: 

* :class:`Bag` - The simplest bag class
* :class:`FrozenBag` - An immutable (and thus hashable) bag class
* :class:`OrderedBag` - A bag class where items are ordered by insertion order
* :class:`FrozenOrderedBag` - An immutable, ordered bag class

What is a bag?
--------------

The :class:`Bag` class is an implementation of the mathematical concept of a
`multiset`_; meaning something like a set, except that every item could appear
multiple times, and crucially, we only save the count of the item in memory
instead of saving multiple copies of the same item, which would be a waste of
memory.

You may know the :class:`collections.Counter` class from Python's standard
library; the bag classes provided by Combi are very similar, except that they
are more strictly defined as multisets, meaning that counts must be positive
integers. (Zeros are allowed in input but they are weeded out.) By contrast,
:class:`collections.Counter` allows any value as an item's count.

This restriction makes the bag classes more powerful than
:class:`collections.Counter` because it allows more methods to be defined. More
arithmetical operations are defined, comparison between bags is supported, and
more.
