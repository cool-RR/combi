Bags
====

Combi provides 4 bag classes: 

* :class:`Bag` - The simplest bag class
* :class:`FrozenBag` - An immutable (and thus hashable) bag class
* :class:`OrderedBag` - A bag class where items are ordered by insertion order
* :class:`FrozenOrderedBag` - An immutable, ordered bag class

.. class:: Bag(iterable={})

   The :class:`Bag` class is an implementation of the mathematical concept of a
   `multiset`_; meaning something like a set, except that every item could appear
   multiple times, and crucially, we only save the count of the item in memory
   instead of saving multiple copies of the same item, which would be a waste of
   memory.
   
   You may know the :class:`collections.Counter` class from Python's standard
   library; the bag classes provided by Combi are very similar, except that they
   are more strictly defined as multisets, meaning that counts must be positive
   integers. (Zeros are allowed in input but they are weeded out.) By contrast,
   :class:`collections.Counter` allows any value as an item's count.
   
   This restriction makes the bag classes more powerful than
   :class:`collections.Counter` because it allows more methods to be defined. More
   arithmetical operations are defined, comparison between bags is supported, and
   more.
   
   When you create a bag, it will be populated with the ``iterable`` argument. If ``iterable`` is a plain sequence, its items will be PHRASING 
   
   

   .. attribute:: maps

       A user updateable list of mappings.  The list is ordered from
       first-searched to last-searched.  It is the only stored state and can
       be modified to change which mappings are searched.  The list should
       always contain at least one mapping.

   .. method:: new_child(m=None)

       Returns a new :class:`ChainMap` containing a new map followed by
       all of the maps in the current instance.  If ``m`` is specified,
       it becomes the new map at the front of the list of mappings; if not
       specified, an empty dict is used, so that a call to ``d.new_child()``
       is equivalent to: ``ChainMap({}, *d.maps)``.  This method is used for
       creating subcontexts that can be updated without altering values in any
       of the parent mappings.

       .. versionchanged:: 3.4
          The optional ``m`` parameter was added.

   .. attribute:: parents

       Property returning a new :class:`ChainMap` containing all of the maps in
       the current instance except the first one.  This is useful for skipping
       the first map in the search.  Use cases are similar to those for the
       :keyword:`nonlocal` keyword used in :term:`nested scopes <nested
       scope>`.  The use cases also parallel those for the built-in
       :func:`super` function.  A reference to ``d.parents`` is equivalent to:
       ``ChainMap(*d.maps[1:])``.
